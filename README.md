# Localator
Localator is a booking management website where you can make reservations at different music venues. 
You can visit the website at http://localator.herokuapp.com/ . Currently the page is not in commercial use and I encourage you to go into it to see all the details. <br>
## Landing
This is the landing of the web. I tried to make a different aesthetic and chose a synthwave look with 3d elements.

<br>

On the web you can add music venues with their different schedules. The schedule that is shown to the owner of the local and the different customers is rendered dynamically according to their opening and closing time. 

## Owner's view

<br>

The strength of the website is the manual creation of the calendar system. It was a difficulty that challenged me for a few days, but I am really proud of it. 
I tried to pay attention to details such as the possibility of reserving as many hours as possible according to the closing time and the rest of the reservations, the fact that the owners of the music venues can see the name of the bands they are reserving while the rest only see the box as occupied or the possibility that the owners of the reservations and the owners of the venues can remove the reservations.

## User's view

This is what an external reservation looks like from the point of view of a band user. If the reservation belonged to the user himself, his name would appear in the box. When making a reservation from a user of a music group, an email is sent to all group members with the address and name of the venue and the time of the reservation by nodemailer.

I leave here a user registered as owner of a test site in case you want to investigate the web. <br>
