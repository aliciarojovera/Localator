# Localator
Localator is a booking management website where you can make reservations at different music venues. 
You can visit the website at http://localator.herokuapp.com/ . Currently the page is not in commercial use and I encourage you to go into it to see all the details. <br>

This is the landing of the web. I tried to make a different aesthetic and chose a synthwave look with 3d elements.

On the web you can add music venues with their different schedules. The schedule that is shown to the owner of the local and the different customers is rendered dynamically according to their opening and closing time.
